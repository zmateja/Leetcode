This is a brute force solution scanning the array twice for any 2 numbers that add up to the sum.
After thinking about it, this can be improved using a hash with the following steps:

1. Create a new hash table/map
2. Scan the Array once, on each number curNum do the following:
- Check if the complement (target - curNum) exists in the hash
- if the complement does not exist, add curNum to the hashmap (stored with its index in some way)
- If the complement does exist, return the complement's index as well as curNum index
